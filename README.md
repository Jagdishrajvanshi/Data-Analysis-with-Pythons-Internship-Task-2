# Data-Analysis-with-Pythons-Internship-Task-2
Data analysis project using Python on the Titanic dataset.  Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations  to study survival patterns based on gender, passenger class, and age.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of a **Data Science with Python Internship**.  
The objective is to analyze the Titanic dataset and identify survival patterns
based on **gender, passenger class, and age**.

## 📊 Dataset
- Titanic dataset loaded using the **Seaborn** library

## 🧪 Tasks Performed
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset
- Handled missing values (Age and Embarked)
- Analyzed survival rates by gender and passenger class
- Visualized data using bar charts and histograms
- Derived insights and conclusions from the analysis

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in higher classes had better survival chances
- Age and passenger class played an important role in survival
